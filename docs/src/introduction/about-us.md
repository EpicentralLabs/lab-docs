# About Us

***Epicentral Labs*** is a development studio and future project incubator on Solana, based in the US and Canada. The team consists of passionate developers and project managers dedicated to introducing innovative solutions and services for new or existing Solana-based projects. The goal is to connect, collaborate, and educate the web community on how blockchain can enhance user experiences. By supporting new and upcoming projects and collaborating with large, well-established ones, Epicentral Labs aims to become the go-to place for startups seeking to make a difference in the Web3 space.

## Our Focus

The focus is on simplifying Solana for non-crypto-savvy internet users by utilizing new and existing ideas, products, and services.

A key priority is to educate on the flexibility of both existing and decentralized applications to foster growth within the Solana community. The aim is to help everyday, non-crypto-oriented individuals understand what can be achieved for investors, consumers, and developers. Whether the focus is on gaming, security, decentralized finance, or other areas, the end goal is to demonstrate that Solana is more than "just crypto" to the world.

Currently, the team is focused on several intriguing sub-projects, including the development of a new DeFi platform for new and existing SPL-token projects. This platform aims to create new incentives for their communities. These initiatives are referred to as [Vault Programs](/vault-program-docs/introduction)â€”customizable staking vaults made simple!

One **problem** observed on Solana is that some projects lack the necessary support to accelerate their growth, both within their communities and in token value. Epicentral Labs seeks to provide tools, consultation, and solutions for projects in need of support, through various methods such as gamification, security enhancements, financing, and more.

In the future, any funds raised through fees or the DAO treasury may be used to provide grants and sponsorships to startup projects or to buy back [LABS Tokens](/introduction/labstoken).

The full potential of Solana is only now being realized, and Epicentral Labs is eager to showcase what it can offer.
