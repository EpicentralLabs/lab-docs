**DAO Link:** [`https://app.realms.today/dao/LABS`](https://app.realms.today/dao/LABS)

*Proudly Created on **[REALMS](https://realms.today/)***

## 🌟 Introduction

*"A [Decentralized Autonomous Organization](/terminology#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao) is a community with a shared bank account. Members of the **DAO** make decisions in a transparent and decentralized fashion, with smart contracts executing these decisions.*

*For instance, a member can create a proposal suggesting an investment of the treasury or a program upgrade. The **DAO** members then come together to vote on the proposal. If a predefined quorum votes for the proposal to pass, the proposal is accepted and and executed by a smart contract.*

*As a result, the **DAO** structure provides a “flat” organizational structure. Each **DAO** member has a voice in the community and the opportunity to drive the direction of the organization."* *- [Realms](https://docs.realms.today/Introduction/whatisadao)*

## 🏛️ Governance Structure

#### 👨‍🔬 Community Members:

Anyone that holds **LABS** tokens is eligible to participate in the DAO through both **Voting** and **Proposing**. Below you will find the minimum **LABS** tokens needed in order to do both actions.

::: tip 💡Pro Tip:
*We recommend you have **0.01 SOL** in your wallet so that your transaction can go through upon doing the below Actions.*

| Action               | Min. LABS Tokens Needed |
|:--------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| **Create** a Proposal: | `54,626 LABS`              |
| **Vote** on a Proposal:| `0.00000001 LABS`          |
| **Veto** a Proposal:   | `0.00000001 LABS`          |
| **Withdraw Vote** from a Proposal:   | `0.00000001 LABS`          |

#### 👨‍🔬 Council Members:

Similar to Community Members, the **Council** is made up of direct contributors to the Epicentral Labs project. This includes but is not limited to the Epicentral Team, Advisors, Collaborators, etc. 

Each Council Member has the right to create a proposal in which ONLY Council Members may part take in. However, the requirements to pass a vote is set at 70% for more unanimous voting.
