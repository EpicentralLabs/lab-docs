# Lab Updates

Are where we categorically showcase a collection of changelogs to show the overall progress in each branch of our focuses. Besides what is published in our GitHub repositories, the next few pages here are made for a more organized and reader-friendly look so that our team and community know what's happening behind the scenes.

## Understanding Changelogs & Releases

For the next few pages, you will find changelogs describing changes made from the beginning of this project up to the most recent changes made. By using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), it makes it quick and easy to understand the level of importance to each update made:

## The Primary Category Naming Guideline
There are **4** primary categories that may be utilized when versioning: 
* **Added, Removed, Bug Fix, and Changes**. *(Listed in that order).*

```rust
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```
*Examples:*

```v1.0.0``` = Major Change

```v0.1.0``` = Minor Change

```v0.0.1``` = Patch

```v0.0.1-beta``` = Beta Release(s)
