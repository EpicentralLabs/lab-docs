Vesting Schedules are important for start up projects and businesses that wish to succeed long term. It is critical that every detail in the tokenomics of LABS is measured precisely so that there aren't any future dilemmas in how to go about releasing tokens.

Token Vesting is essential in order to reduce large inflationary outcomes and provide market stability.

*You can read more about ["What is Token Vesting Security?"](https://blog.streamflow.finance/what-is-token-vesting-security/) by [Streamflow](https://streamflow.finance/)*, they go into great detail covering more specifics on the pros and cons of token vesting versus not.

## Total Token Accumulation

Self-explanitory. However, it is important to note that over the next 13 months, the circulating supply will increase and will eventually cap at the Total Supply amount. 

Understanding how this affects price is important. If you don't understand basic economics such as **supply and demand**, we recommend you [read more about it here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033115/how-does-law-supply-and-demand-affect-prices.asp#:~:text=The%20law%20of%20supply%20and%20demand%20centers%20on%20prices%20that,while%20demand%20increases%2C%20prices%20rise.).

## Token Circulating Supply Schedule
