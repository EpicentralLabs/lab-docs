*Proudly Created on **[REALMS](https://realms.today/)***

## üåü Introduction

*"A [Decentralized Autonomous Organization](/terminology#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao) is a community with a shared bank account. Members of the **DAO** make decisions in a transparent and decentralized fashion, with smart contracts executing these decisions.*

*For instance, a member can create a proposal suggesting an investment of the treasury or a program upgrade. The **DAO** members then come together to vote on the proposal. If a predefined quorum votes for the proposal to pass, the proposal is accepted and and executed by a smart contract.*

*As a result, the **DAO** structure provides a ‚Äúflat‚Äù organizational structure. Each **DAO** member has a voice in the community and the opportunity to drive the direction of the organization."* *- [Realms](https://docs.realms.today/Introduction/whatisadao)*

## üèõÔ∏è DAO Structure

The governance structure and DAO rules will be shown below. Please keep in mind that these rules are subject to change *IF* the community members agree on doing so. 

Voting time for all members on proposals is `3 days`.

- `2.5 days` is the ***<span style="color:#00FFA3">Unrestricted Voting Time Period</span>***
- `0.5 days` is the ***<span style="color:#00FFA3">Cool-Off Voting Time Period</span>***.

::: details Unrestricted Voting Time
The amount of time a voter has to **approve** or **deny** a proposal.
:::

::: details Cool-Off Voting Time
After the unrestricted voting time, this is the amount of time a voter has to **deny**, **veto**, or **withdraw** a vote on a proposal.

### ‚úä Governance Power

Governance power is determined by how many **LABS** tokens are ***delegated*** (deposited) into the DAO, ***i.e.*** `1 LABS == 1 Vote or Governance Power`.

Members that have **LABS** delegated are then able to participate in the DAO and there are 2 types of members.

#### üë®‚Äçüî¨ Community Members

Anyone that holds **LABS** tokens is eligible to participate in the DAO through both **Voting** and **Proposing**. in the [Minimum Requirements to Participate](/epicentral-dao/introduction#üèõ-mininmum-requirements-to-participate) section, you will find the minimum **LABS** tokens needed in order to do both actions. 

| Attribute               | Value   |
|-------------------------|---------|
| **Voting Threshold**    | 60%     |
| **Community Vote Tipping** | Early  |
| **Unrestricted Voting Time** | 60 hrs  |
| **Cool-off Voting Time** | 12 hrs  |

#### üë®‚Äçüî¨ Council Members

Similar to Community Members, the **Council** is made up of direct contributors to the Epicentral Labs project. This includes but is not limited to the Epicentral Team, Advisors, Collaborators, etc. 

Each Council Member has the right to create a proposal in which ONLY Council Members may part take in. However, the requirements to pass a vote is set at 70% for more unanimous voting.

| Attribute               | Value   |
|-------------------------|---------|
| **Voting Threshold**    | 70%     |
| **Council Vote Tipping** | Early  |
| **Unrestricted Voting Time** | 60 hrs  |
| **Cool-off Voting Time** | 12 hrs  |

During the *<span style="color:#00FFA3">Cool-Off Voting Time Period</span>*, depending on whether the proposal is created by the community or by council, members of both groups have the power to ***Veto***, otherwise known as "deny" or "cancel", a proposal if seen fit.
