# Withdrawal & Deployment Fees

This page outlines the designated fees and how Epicentral Labs plans to sustain its presence on Solana while fostering project token utility, sustainability, and community loyalty.

## Fractional-Fee Model

Epicentral Labs has implemented a structured fee system to support the longevity of [Vaults](/terminology#vault) and maintain community loyalty for the associated projects.

The model includes a primary withdrawal fee that is divided between the associated [Vault](/terminology#vault), the [Vault Creator](/terminology#vault-creator), and an additional fee route chosen by the Vault Creator. The Vault Creator can direct this additional fee to:

* **A [DAO](/terminology#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao) Treasury of their choice.**
* **Another Wallet/Team Wallet Address of their choice.**
* **Reinvest it back into the associated Vault for added sustainability.**

This fractional-fee model is designed to balance the incentive structure among all users while also supporting the initial Vault Creator.

## Withdrawal Fees

::: tip 
The only fee a user should expect to pay is **for withdrawal**. There are no deposit fees. The withdrawal fee is divided into three different parts:

| Redistributed back into the [Reward Pool](/terminology#predetermined-reward-pool) to ensure longer sustainability. | This portion by default goes to the [Vault Creator](/terminology#vault-creator), whether it be an individual wallet or a [DAO](/terminology#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao). | This portion by default is routed to the associated Vault but can also be allocated to any other address. |
