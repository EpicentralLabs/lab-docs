# üèõÔ∏è DAO Voting Guide

Just as you would vote in your standard "shareholder meeting", you are able to cast a vote to have your voice heard since each **LABS** token equates to 1 vote.

## üó≥Ô∏è How to Vote

::: warning üí° Note: 
You **must** have at least `0.000000001 LABS` tokens in order to vote. We recommend you have at least `0.01 SOL` to cover transaction fees!
:::

### 1. Go to EpicentralDAO on Realms

[`https://app.realms.today/dao/LABS`]()

### 2. Connect your Wallet

**Accepted Wallets:** *Phantom, Backpack, Torus, Glow, Solflare, Sollet, Exodus, & WalletConnect*.

### 3. Delegate LABS to Gain Governance Power

In order to create a proposal, **you must delegate a *minimum* of `54,626 LABS`** in order to create a proposal. 

::: warning üí° Note:
When delegating for the first time, you will need to pay the rent to create an ATA (Associated Token Account) which costs `0.002 SOL`.

You can always remove your delegation from the DAO and back into your wallet at the expense of either cancelling your proposal and/or withdrawing your vote (if any are active).

### 4. Select a Proposal to Vote on

You will usually find the most recent proposal listed at the **top.** To learn more about what each proposal means and/or vote, **click into the proposal**

### 5. Cast Vote

Each vote is equal to how many tokens you have delegated to the DAO `(1 LABS == 1 Vote)` 

::: warning üí° Note:
If you wish to remove your delegation, you will then have to withdraw your vote and then withdraw from the DAO. 
:::

Select your choice and click "Vote". Accept wallet confirmations as needed.
