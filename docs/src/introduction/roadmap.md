  - **AMA "In The Lab" Episodes**

    - AMA (Ask Me Anything) Events are important to build a better relationship with the ever-growing Solana space. **"In The Lab"** episodes are a special twist to how AMAs normally occur. These episodes work close to how podcasts would occur. During these episodes, the team covers details and various work-in-progress updates about Epicentral Labs. During the episodes, members who participate during the live episode are able to ask questions about the project.

  - **Streamflow Finance**

    - Streamflow Finance allowed the team to create vesting contracts that are locked away for a certain period of time. You can learn/read more about the vesting contracts in our documentation here: [LABS Token Vesting Schedule](/labs-token/labstoken-vesting#üìÜ-labs-token-vesting-schedule)

  - **Realms**

    - Realms provides tooling to help us create the [EpicentralDAO](/epicentral-dao/introduction#üèõ-epicentraldao). Realms utilized the native governance programs on Solana and created a good-to-go UI for projects like ourselves who need that self governance with ease.

    - A developer tool, that eliminates the unnecessary steps and barriers needed to create/mint tokens on Solana.
    - A transparent application that gives users the option to either pay with SOL or LABS.

  - **Create LABS/USDC CLMM Pool**
    
    - Instead of a traditional AMM (Automated Market Maker) Pool with a `0.25%` swap fees on Raydium, a CLMM (Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker) Pool is more capital efficient for capital efficient for liqudity providers. The Epicentral Team is to release a LABS/USDC CLMM pool with `0.05%` swap fees instead.
  
  - **Create LABS/JitoSOL CLMM Pool**

  - **Initialize LABS Token Farming**

    - Create a Farm using the DAO Trasury funds on Raydium to incentivise liquidity providers. Amount has not been determined yet.

  - **Collaborate with Dual Finance**

    - Dual Finance offers a new token incentive mechanism by granting users (and the team) from the Epicentral Community to lock-up liquid token for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase tokens at a specific future price. This is known as Staking Options. This will offer better and more sustainable liquidity offering for Epicentral Labs. Learn more [here](https://www.dual.finance/).
