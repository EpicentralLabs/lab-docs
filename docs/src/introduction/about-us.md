## 🧫 Current Projects

### Developer Tooling

We look to simplify the tasks a Solana developer may face when getting started. Because of the transactional nature of Solana, tokens are utilized to perform functionality in some way or another. Currently we are working hard to offer Solana the ultimate developer tool: **The Token Lab**. 

#### 🪙 The Token Lab

Solana's most simple and transparent token creator.  ***More info on this soon!***
- No Code

### Expanding DeFi

We're putting a twist on an existing style of doing DeFi. By building a better way for new and existing SPL-token projects. This platform aims to create new incentives with ease for both small and large communities.

#### 🔐 [Vault-Programs](/vault-program-docs/introduction)

Our flagship initiative involves customizable staking vaults designed for simplicity and effectiveness.

### 🔬 Problem-Solving Initiatives

We've observed that some projects on Solana lack necessary support for growth. To address this, we're developing:

- Tools for Developers (such as The Token Lab)
- On-boarding more users to the Solana Ecosystem
- Solutions for project acceleration, security & incentives

**Our methods include:**
- Gamification
- Security enhancements
- Financing options

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Consider buy-backs of LABS Tokens
- Continue exploring and showcasing Solana's full potential
