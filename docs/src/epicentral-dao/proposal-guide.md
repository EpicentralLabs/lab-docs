# üèõÔ∏è DAO Proposal Guide

[DAO](/terminology#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao) proposals can be thought of similarly to how shareholders may submit ideas to the Board of Directors, who represent the shareholders, regarding a particular idea or direction for a company. In this case, there is no Board of Directors; instead, you directly present an idea to the entire community.

The **DAO** is a great way to get involved directly with Epicentral Labs, its community, and its team. Below you will find a simple, **Step-by-Step** guide on how to **create** a new proposal.

## üìú How to Create a Proposal

::: warning üí° Note: 
You **must** have `54,626 LABS` tokens in order to create a proposal. We recommend you have at least `0.01 SOL` to cover transaction fees!
:::

### 1. Go to EpicentralDAO on Realms

[`https://app.realms.today/dao/LABS`]()

### 2. Connect your Wallet

**Accepted Wallets:** *Phantom, Backpack, Torus, Glow, Solflare, Sollet, Exodus, & WalletConnect*.

### 3. Delegate LABS to Gain Governance Power

In order to create a proposal, **you must delegate a *minimum* of `54,626 LABS`** in order to create a proposal. 

::: warning üí° Note:
When delegating for the first time, you will need to pay the rent to create an ATA (Associated Token Account) which costs `0.002 SOL`.

You can always remove your delegation from the DAO and back into your wallet at the expense of either cancelling your proposal and/or withdrawing your vote (if any are active).

### 5. Add Information to New Proposal

When creating a New Proposal, kindly add the appropriate **Title** and **Description**. Decide whether this proposal is an ***Executable*** or a ***Non-Executable***

::: details Executable
An "Executable" proposal is instruction-based, which means that you must select an instruction in order to create the proposal. 

***For example:** An instruction to "Transfer Tokens from the DAO Treasury into another wallet", etc.*

If you are unfamiliar with instructions on Solana, you can read more about it [here](https://solana.com/docs/core/transactions).
:::

::: details Non-Executable
This is the equivilant of a "multiple-choice question". Therefore, no executions on the blockchain occur *besides* creating the proposal and voting on it.
:::

::: warning üí°Warning:
If **"Vote by council"** is enabled, then ONLY the Council Members are able to vote on your proposal. If you wish for only the community to vote, leave **"Vote by council"** disabled.

::: tip üí° Tip
Instead of typing the entire proposal in the "Description" section in the DAO, we have created a template to help community members write their proposals in a more structured format. You can [use the Google Doc Template here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_z67izmVjSKHc6393I9negRfWLpoeocNza5pZoAQ3L0/edit?usp=sharing).
:::

### 6. Add Proposal

When finished, add the necessary instructions needed for your proposal and select **"Add proposal"**. You will need to confirm the transactions using your wallet.
