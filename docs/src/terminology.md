### Annual Percentrage Yield (APY)
APY is the interest rate earned on an investment in one year, including compounding interest, and is the actual rate of return that will be earned in one year if the interest is [compounded](/terminology#compound-interest). ([Learn more](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apy.asp#:~:text=What%20Is%20the%20Annual%20Percentage,with%20the%20highest%20possible%20return.))

### Associated Token
This is the token that is related to the Vault Program which hosts it.

### Bounty
Also known as a task that needs to be completed in return for a contributor reward.

### Changelogs
Details that are released by developers that outline fixes, changes, and new additions made to a project with the latest update.

### Compound Interest
Interest that is added periodically to the total investment, ultimately increasing the balance. That means each interest payment will be larger, based on the higher balance. ([Learn more](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp))

### Contributor Rewards
These are rewards for those who have either found and/or fixed program bugs or completed bounties set by the VaultiFi team or community via the [DAO](/terminology#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao).

### Decentralized Application (dApp)
Digital applications that run on a blockchain network of computers instead of relying on a single computer. ([Learn more](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralized-applications-dapps.asp))

### Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)
A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an emerging form of legal structure that has no central governing body and whose members share a common goal to act in the best interest of the entity. A DAO is an entity structure in which tokenholders participate in the management and decision-making of an entity. ([Learn more](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-dao/#:~:text=A%20decentralized%20autonomous%20organization%20(DAO)%20is%20an%20emerging%20form%20of,best%20interest%20of%20the%20entity.))

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
Decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi, leverages new technology to eliminate intermediaries and central authorities from financial dealings. It consists of cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and applications enabling direct financial transactions between users. ([Learn more](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835))

### Developer/Community Bounties
Interchangeable with "contributor rewards". However, it's more specific to rewards relating to project/program development and progression. These bounties are initially set by the Epicentral Team and hopefully then later on proposed by the community via a [DAO](/terminology#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao).

### Expected Reward
This is a simple calculation to better showcase what the [depositor](/terminology#the-user) should expect per payout based on how much has already been deposited. This gets [compounded](/terminology#compound-interest) on every payout therefore the number will change after the [Reward Frequency](/terminology#reward-frequency-rf) timer has completed its [Reward Cycle](/terminology#reward-cycle).

### Fixed Annual Percentage Yield (F-APY)
A "fixed" APY cannot be changed by [Vault Creators](/terminology#vault-creator) and can be integrated with a DAO where community members can vote on the frequency of the rewards distributed.

### Liquidity Pool
A liquidity pool is a crowdsourced pool of cryptocurrencies or tokens locked in a smart contract that is used to facilitate trades between the assets on a decentralized exchange (DEX). Instead of traditional markets of buyers and sellers, many decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms use automated market makers (AMMs), which allow digital assets to be traded in an automatic and permissionless manner through the use of liquidity pools. ([Learn more](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/what-is-a-liquidity-pool-crypto-market-liquidity#section-the-role-of-crypto-liquidity-pools-in-de-fi))

### Market Risk
Market risk is the possibility that an individual or other entity will experience losses due to factors that affect the overall performance of investments in the financial markets. This includes but is not limited to cryptocurrency, crypto tokens, stocks, options, commodities, etc. ([Learn more](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketrisk.asp))

### Predetermined Reward Pool 
A pool of tokens that are pre-allocated before launching a [Vault](/terminology#vault). These tokens are then distributed via the specified [Reward Frequency](/terminology#reward-frequency-rf) to the Vault depositors.

### Project
Interchangeably used for "crypto-token projects", "business/company", "memecoins", "open-source projects", "tokenized Solana community", "[decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)](/terminology#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao)", "[decentralized/applications](/terminologY#decentralized-application-dapp)", or anything related to a developed idea.

### Reward Cycle
A Reward Cycle counts when the [Reward Frequency](/terminology#reward-frequency-rf) timer reaches zero and resets the timer back to the start.

### Reward Frequency (RF)
The rate at which a payout happens automatically within a [Vault](/terminology#vault).

### Reward Tokens
These tokens are the tokens allocated to the [predetermined reward pool]() and are paid out to [depositors](/terminology#the-user). 

### Rewards
A "reward" is used interchangeably with "payouts", and "token distribution/payout". Rewards are earned when a depositor receives [interest]() on their deposit into a [Vault](/terminology#vault).

### Rewards Remaining
This is the token amount remaining in the Vault that is ready to be distributed to [depositors](/terminology#the-user). This number will go down over time unless more [reward tokens](/terminology#reward-tokens) are added to the [predetermined reward pool]() by the [Vault Creator](/terminology#vault-creator).

### SPL-Token
Solana, like Ethereum, supports other tokens as well as native SOL. SPL is the token standard for Solana network tokens, analogous to ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum network. These tokens can be utilized for programs, governance, and DeFi protocols. ([Learn more](https://spl.solana.com/token))

### Solana Program
Solana Programs, often referred to as "smart contracts" on other blockchains, are the executable code that interprets the instructions sent inside of each transaction on the blockchain. ([Learn more](https://solana.com/docs/core/programs))

### Staking
A way of earning rewards while holding onto certain cryptocurrencies/crypto-tokens. ([Learn more](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-staking))

### The User
Also known as a *Depositor*, is the person/wallet that interacts with and deposits tokens into a [Vault](/terminology#vault).

### Tokenomics
Combines the concepts of 'token' and 'economics' to examine how cryptocurrencies and tokens are created, circulated, and valued. ([Learn more](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/tokenomics#:~:text=15%20January%202024-,What%20is%20Tokenomics%3F,to%20its%20utility%20and%20more.))

### Total Tokens Vaulted
This is the total amount of tokens that have been deposited into a [Vault](/terminology#vault).

### Variable Annual Percentage Yield (V-APY)
A "variable" APY can be changed by [Vault Creators](/terminology#vault-creator) and can be integrated with a DAO where community members can vote on the [frequency of the rewards](/terminology#reward-frequency-rf) distributed as well as the [yield rate](/terminology#annual-percentrage-yield-apy).

### Vault
A "Vault" is a [Solana Program](/terminology#solana-program) that acts as a savings account for [token programs](https://spl.solana.com/token) and behaves similarly to a [staking program](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-staking). A Vault rewards users and spl-token projects by paying out token depositors, providing project sustainability, and creating spl-token utility.

### Vault Creator
These are the token project owners/developers and are, by default, in charge of setting conditions to a [Vault](/terminology#vault).

### Vault Deployment Fee
One-time fee to create a Vault and deploy it.

### Withdrawal Fee
The fee incurred when [The User](/terminology#the-user) withdraws tokens from a Vault. 

### Yield Farming
Yield farming refers to depositing tokens into a liquidity pool on a DeFi protocol to earn rewards, typically paid out in the protocol’s governance token. ([Learn more](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/yield-farming-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work/))
